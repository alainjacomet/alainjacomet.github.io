This is my first post using Jekyll as blogging engine and served on Github pages.

## Purpose of this blog

The purpose of this blog is to be a personal website that includes notes on the different things I discover.

I plan on documenting a lot of things that I do, which include:

- Travels across the world.
- Code & software blogging.
- Entrepreneurship & startups.
